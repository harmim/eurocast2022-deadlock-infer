\vspace*{-4mm}\section{Introduction}\vspace*{-1.5mm}
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

With multi-core processors present in every newer computer, multi-threaded
programs are becoming increasingly common.
%
However, multi-threaded programs require proper synchronisation to restrict the
thread interleavings and make the program produce correct results.
%
Failing to do so often leads to various critical errors, which occur under some
very specific timing scenarios only, and hence standard testing and debugging
techniques are less effective or even useless for detecting them.


\emph{Atomicity violations} are a class of errors which result from an incorrect
definition of the scope of an atomic region.
%
Such errors are usually hard to localize and diagnose, which becomes even harder
when using a (third-party) software library where it is unknown to the
programmer how to form the atomic regions correctly when accessing the library.
%
Even new synchronisation techniques, such as transactional memories, designed to
ease the process of writing concurrent programs, do not entirely avoid this
problem as transactional memory programs may suffer from atomicity violations as
well~\cite{hvc:2013:dias}.


One way to address the problem of proper atomicity is to associate a
\emph{contract} with each program module/library~\cite{contracts92}.
%
In general, a contract regulates the use of methods of an object by specifying a
set of pre-conditions the program must meet before calling the object methods.
%
In our context, one can, in particular, use the notion of a \emph{contract for
concurrency}~\cite{tr:2014:d_sousa}, having the form of a set of terms where
each term defines a sequence of method calls that must be executed atomically.  
%
% If the contract terms are violated, atomicity violations may (but don't have
% to) occur at runtime. 
%
Contract terms may be written by the software module/library developer or
inferred automatically from the program~\cite{tr:2014:d_sousa}. 
% 
% Detecting violations to the contract terms may help avoiding atomicity
% violations during program execution.

% To detect an atomicity violation, one has to check whether a contract is
% violated in the execution of a program, i.e., whether there is a sequence of
% method calls which should be executed atomically, but the atomicity is not
% enforced during the execution.
%
In this paper, assuming that the appropriate contracts for concurrency have been
obtained, we devise a technique for their dynamic validation at program run
time.

\vspace*{-2.5mm}\section{Dynamic Validation of Contracts}\vspace*{-1.5mm}
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In~\cite{contract13,tr:2014:d_sousa}, a static approach to contract validation
has been proposed. This approach can prove that a contract can never be
violated. However, in practice, it scales to relatively small programs only. For
more complex programs, one has to restrict the analysis to program fragments,
e.g., individual methods, in order to achieve reasonable performance. This
restriction leads to a loss of precision and to false alarms as the analysis
does not know whether a sequence of method calls may be interleaved with method
calls from other threads at all. Thus, a~contract violation might be reported
even when a~sequence of method calls needs not be executed atomically because no
other thread may interfere with it.  Another problem is that of dealing with
imprecise information about the objects whose methods are called. Hence, calls
of methods on different objects are mixed together, again leading to possible
false alarms.

In order to detect atomicity violations in more complex programs and to reduce
the number of false alarms, we propose a dynamic approach to check whether a
contract is violated or not. Our dynamic validation checks whether a contract is
violated during a concrete execution of a program. Possible violations not seen
during the witnessed execution of the program are missed, but all of the methods
encountered during the execution are taken into account, and so contract
violations caused by method calls from all over the program are detected.
Because all of the threads are running and all objects are known when the
program is executing, no false alarms are reported as we know precisely whether
all of the methods called in a sequence use the same object and which method
calls might interleave this sequence. 

Since we concentrate on contract violations seen in concrete executions, we can
avoid false alarms, but on the other hand, we can miss some errors. In order to
minimize this possibility, we employ dynamic analysis techniques, such as vector
clocks and lock sets \cite{velodrome08}, in order to extrapolate the actually
witnessed behaviour and hence detect possible contract violations even when they
were not actually witnessed.  Moreover, we use a specialised blend of noise
injection techniques \cite{noise14} to enforce even rare synchronization
scenarios leading to behaviours (and possibly contract violations) we would not
cover by using extrapolation of the common synchronization scenarios only.

\vspace*{-2mm}\section{Related Work}\vspace*{-1.5mm}
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The design by contract (DBC) methodology~\cite{contracts92} allows one to
produce robust code that follows contracts between programs and objects.
Contracts in the form of regular expressions were used to specify protocols for
accessing objects in sequential~\cite{Cheon07} as well as concurrent
scenarios~\cite{Hurlin09,contract13,tr:2014:d_sousa}.
In~\cite{tr:2014:d_sousa,contract13}, the contracts are validated statically
which does not scale well. In~\cite{Hurlin09}, a technique to validate
correctness of contracts by proving contracts on a set of artificially generated
programs that use particular object is presented. Our approach of combining
contracts, dynamic analysis, and noise injection techniques scales well and is
able to validate contracts in real multi-threaded programs.
