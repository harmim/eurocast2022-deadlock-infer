%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nowadays, programs often use \emph{multithreading} to utilise the many
processors of current computers better.
%
However, concurrency does bring not only speed-ups but also a~much larger space
for nasty errors easy to cause but difficult to find.
%
The reason why finding errors in concurrent programs is particularly hard is
that the concurrently running threads may \emph{interleave} in many different
ways, with bugs hiding in just a~few of them.
%
Such interleavings need not be discovered even by many-times repeated testing.


Coverage of such rare behaviours can be improved by approaches such as
\emph{systematic testing}~\cite{schedspec12} and \emph{noise-based
testing}~\cite{noise14}.
%
% \cite{contestframework03,anaconda}.
%
Another way is using \emph{extrapolating dynamic checkers}, such
as~\cite{fasttrack09},
%
% \cite{atomsetser08,velodrome08,realdeadlock09,fasttrack09},
%
which can report warnings about possible errors even if those are not seen in
the testing runs, based on spotting some of their symptoms.
%
Unfortunately, even though such checkers have proven quite useful in practice,
they can, of course, still miss errors.
%
Moreover, monitoring a~run of large software through such checkers may be quite
expensive too.

On the other hand, approaches based on \emph{model checking}, i.e., exhaustive
state-space exploration, can guarantee the discovery of all potentially present
errors.
%
% ---either in general or at least up to some bound, which is usually given in
% the number of context switches.
%
However, the scalability of these techniques is so far not sufficient to handle
truly large industrial code, even when combining it with methods such as
\emph{sequentialisation}~\cite{lazy-seq-16},
%
% \cite{lal-reps-08,abou-seq-11,lazy-seq-16},
%
which represents one of the most scalable approaches in the area.

An alternative to the above approaches, which can scale better than model
checking and can find bugs not found dynamically (though for the price of
potentially missing some errors and/or producing false alarms), is offered by
approaches based on \emph{static analysis}, e.g., in the form of \emph{abstract
interpretation} or \emph{data-flow analysis}.
%
The former approach is supported, e.g., in \emph{Facebook Infer}\,---\,an
open-source framework for creating highly scalable, compositional, incremental,
and interprocedural static analysers based on abstract
interpretation~\cite{inferNFM15}.
%
% Facebook Infer has grown considerably, but it is still under active
% development.
%
% It is employed every day not only in Facebook itself but also in other
% companies, such as Spotify, Uber, Mozilla, or Amazon.
%
Currently, Infer provides several analysers that check for various types of
bugs, such as buffer overflows, null-dereferencing, or memory leaks.
%
% However, most importantly, Facebook Infer is a~\emph{framework} for building
% new analysers quickly and easily.
%
As for \emph{concurrency-related bugs}, Infer provides support for finding
some forms of \emph{data races} and \emph{deadlocks}, but it is limited to
high-level Java and C++ programs~\cite{racerD18,inferCACM19}.
%
In this work, we propose a~\emph{deadlock checker} that fits the common
principles of analyses used in Infer and is applicable to \emph{C~code} with
\emph{lower-level lock manipulation}.
%
Our checker is called L2D2 for ``low-level deadlock detector''.

%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
\enlargethispage{6mm}
%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Out of existing static deadlock detectors, L2D2 is probably the closest to
\mbox{RacerX}~\cite{racerX03}, and some of the approaches used in L2D2 are
inspired by RacerX.
%
However, unlike L2D2, RacerX uses a~context-sensitive analysis, meaning that
each function needs to be re-analysed in a~new context, which reduces the
scalability.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\vspace*{-3.5mm}\section{Static Deadlock Detection in Low-Level Concurrent
C~Code}\vspace*{-2mm}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For scalability reasons, L2D2 runs \emph{along the call tree} of a~given
program, \emph{starting from its leaves}.
%
Each function is analysed just once without any knowledge of its possible call
contexts.
%
For each analysed function, we derive a~\emph{summary} that consists of
a~\emph{pre-condition} and \emph{post-condition}.
%
The summaries are then used when analysing functions higher up in the call
hierarchy.
%
% Intuitively, the pre-condition states what states of locks the function
% expects from its callers, and the post-condition reflects the effect of the
% function on the locks.
%
% More precisely,
%
Intuitively, the pre-condition of a~function states which locks are
\emph{expected to be locked or unlocked} upon a~call of the function to avoid
possible double-locking or unlocking, resp.
%
The post-condition contains information about which locks \emph{may be locked or
unlocked} at the exit of the function.
%
Next, the summary contains so-called \emph{lock dependencies} in the form of
pairs of locks $ (l_1, l_2) $ where locking of~$ l_2 $ was seen while~$ l_1 $
was locked.
%
At the end of the analysis, detecting cycles in the lock dependencies is used
to detect possible deadlocks.
%
Finally, the summary also contains information on which \emph{locks may be
locked and then again unlocked} within the given function, which is needed for
detecting lock dependencies with such locks in functions higher up in the call
hierarchy.

L2D2 further implements several heuristics intended to decrease the number
of possible false alarms.
%
For instance, since double-locking/unlocking errors are quite rare, their
detection may instead be used as an indicator that the analysis is
over-approximating too much, and it may reset (some of) the working sets.
%
An example of another heuristic used in L2D2 is the detection of so-called
\emph{gate locks}, i.e., locks guarding other locks (upon which deadlocks on the
nested locks are not reported).

Within our experimental evaluation of L2D2, we have applied it on a~set of 1,002
C~programs with POSIX threads derived from a~Debian GNU/Linux distribution,
originally prepared for evaluating the static deadlock analyser based on
the~CProver framework proposed in~\cite{kroening16}.
%
The~benchmark consists of 11.4\,MLOC.
%
Eight of the programs contain a~known deadlock.
%
Like CProver, L2D2 was able to detect all the deadlocks.
%
On the remaining 994 programs, it produced 39 false alarms (78 of the programs
failed to compile since the Infer's front-end does not support some of the
constructions used).
%
We find this very encouraging, considering that the CProver's deadlock
detector produced 114 false alarms, 453 timeouts (w.r.t. our 30-minute time
limit), and ran out of the available 24\,GB of memory in 135 cases.
%
Altogether, L2D2 consumed less than~1\,\% of the time taken by CProver.
